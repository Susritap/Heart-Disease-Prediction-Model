Report on Predicting Heart Disease:

1. Key Preprocessing Steps Taken

The dataset used for this task contained various features such as BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Drinking, and more. Here are the main preprocessing steps applied:

•	Handling Missing Data: As confirmed during the analysis, the dataset had no missing values, so no imputation was necessary.

•	Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical columns like Sex, Smoking, Alcohol Drinking, Stroke, DiffWalking, Age Category, GenHealth, and Diabetic were label-encoded using scikit-learn’s Label Encoder. This was crucial to convert the categorical data into numerical form suitable for the Logistic Regression model.

•	Feature Selection: We dropped the Race column from the dataset since it was deemed not crucial for our analysis, focusing more on lifestyle-related factors and health indicators.

•	Splitting Data: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split, with 70% for training the model and 30% for testing it.

2. Model Choice and Rationale

The model chosen for this task was Logistic Regression, which is a suitable choice for binary classification problems where the target variable is either "Yes" or "No" (in this case, whether the patient was readmitted or not).

Why Logistic Regression?

•	Simplicity: Logistic regression provides a straightforward interpretation of coefficients, allowing us to understand the effect of each feature on the likelihood of readmission.

•	Efficiency: It performs well with large datasets and is computationally inexpensive compared to more complex models.

•	Probability Outputs: Logistic regression provides probabilities for classification, making it easier to interpret the likelihood of a patient being readmitted.

3. Performance Metrics of the Model

The Logistic Regression model was evaluated based on several metrics:

•	Accuracy: 91%

•	Precision: 0.51 (for class 1 – predicting readmission)

•	Recall: 0.09 (for class 1 – predicting readmission)

•	F1-Score: 0.15 (for class 1 – predicting readmission)


Interpretation:

•	The model had a high accuracy (91%), largely due to the imbalance in the dataset (with significantly more cases of no readmission).

•	The precision for predicting readmission was moderate (0.51), but the recall was low (0.09), meaning that the model struggled to capture all the true positives (actual readmitted patients).

•	The F1-Score combines precision and recall, particularly useful for evaluating models on imbalanced datasets.

4. Theoretical Explanation of Logistic Regression

Feature Values(x1,x2,...,xn): Represent the features in xtrain and xtest.

Intercept: Learned by the model, accessible via model. intercept_

Coefficients: These coefficients are learned by the model during training and determine the influence of each feature on the predicted outcome, accessible via model.coef_

Sigmoid Function: Applied automatically within logistic regression to transform the linear combination of the inputs into a probability. The sigmoid function ensures that the output is a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of class 1.

5. Suggested Improvements

The model's performance, particularly in terms of recall and F1-score for predicting patient readmission, could be improved in the following ways:

•	Balancing the Dataset: The dataset is imbalanced (with far more non-readmission cases), which could explain the model’s low recall. Techniques like oversampling the minority class or under sampling the majority class, or using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE), could help the model perform better on the minority class.

•	Trying More Complex Models: Models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost could better capture the non-linear relationships between features. These models also handle class imbalances more effectively and often outperform simpler linear models like Logistic Regression on more complex datasets.

•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search or random search can be used to find the optimal hyperparameters for logistic regression or other models, potentially improving their performance.

•	Feature Engineering: Creating interaction terms between key features, such as BMI and PhysicalHealth, could improve the model’s predictive power by capturing relationships that may not be evident from the individual features alone.
